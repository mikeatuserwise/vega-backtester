# VEGA Backtester Dashboard

An advanced internal dashboard for backtesting day trading strategies with real market data, designed to help you and your team identify which trading styles actually make money before risking real capital.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose

**Shows you which trading style actually makes money** - Instead of guessing or watching random videos, you can see which strategy (like scalping or momentum) would have made the most consistent profit in the past.

## âœ¨ Key Features

### ðŸ’° Real Capital Backtesting
- **Plug in your real capital** - Enter $50,000 and see what would have happened to that money if you ran each strategy historically
- **Accurate performance calculations** - See exactly how your capital would have grown (or shrunk) with each strategy

### ðŸ”§ Strategy Testing & Tweaking
Test and tweak strategies before risking real money by changing:
- **How many stocks you trade**
- **How many trades per day**
- **Profit target / stop loss per trade**
- **Max risk / drawdown limits**
- **Trading hours and time-based exits**
- **Commission and slippage costs**

### ðŸ“Š Strategy Comparison
- **Side-by-side analysis** of trading strategies and their performance
- **Top day trading strategies** including:
  - Micro Scalping
  - Momentum Trading
  - Mean Reversion

### ðŸ“ˆ Stock Selection
- **Choose which stocks to trade**:
  - Upload your own list of tickers via CSV
  - Use "Top X Recommended" feature for strategy-optimized selections
  - Individual ticker management (add/remove per strategy)
  - Clear all tickers with one click

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Recommendations
- **Strategy-specific recommendations** - Micro-scalping recommends high-volume, liquid stocks with tight spreads
- **Top X Recommended** feature with simple input and checkbox selection
- **Real-time ticker validation** using Polygon.io data

### ðŸ“Š Real Market Data Simulation
- **Uses Polygon.io API** for real historical market data
- **Minute-by-minute simulation** like real life trading

- **Trade-by-trade breakdown** with hold times and exit reasons
- **Monthly performance tracking**

### ðŸ§  Strategy Focus Decision Making
